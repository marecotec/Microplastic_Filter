# Build log and bill of materials

Constructing a system similar to the *URI Microplastic Pump-Filter System* is a fairly simple process providing you have access to the tools required. All the components bar a few 3D printed parts can be purchased off the shelf following the [Bill of Materials](Bill_of_Materials.xlsx). The system needs a moderately powered gas (or electrical pump if you have power) pump to operate, and we maintain two Honda Pumps (WX15T and WMP20X). Pump selection is exceptionally context specific and will need to be investigated depending on several factors.

## Tools used

- 3D printer
- 2 x pipe wrenches
- Adjustable wrenches
- Electrical drill
- Drill bits of associated sizes
- Cheater bar

## Building

First, acquire all parts and 3D print parts needed (extrusion angle brackets and the main tube system holder). Assemble all the 0.75 inch stainless pipe and the extrusion. Ensure all joints are sealed with either thread tape or pipe dope and are adequately tightened to avoid leaks (leaks will reduce the pump efficiency and impact your readings on the flow meter).

General steps:
1. Assemble frame the frame construction.
2. Plumb in the filter housings. This can be tricky to get them all in near vertical alignment and you may need to add signifcant torque to get the housings to align.
3. Prepare the aluminum angle support bar to hold the filter housings together, drill as appropriate to take the bolts for the top of the housings.
4. Mount all 3D printed pipe clamp halves, and then attach the tops to secure the frame to the system.

## 3D printed parts

We printed our 3D printed parts with a high infill for strength and used PETG filament on a Prusa i3 MK3S.
